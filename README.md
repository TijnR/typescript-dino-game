OLD SCHOOL PROJECT
# TypeScript Dino Game

Live Demo ↗

---

This project is a small browser game inspired by the classic Google Chrome dino game you see when you’re offline. I built it as a way to practice my TypeScript skills.

It’s a fun little project, but isn’t perfect and could use some improvements. Despite that, I enjoyed making it and learned a lot along the way.
